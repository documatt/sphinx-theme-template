# Sample document

This document demonstrates Markdown syntax. Professional books and tech documentation are plain text files with this easy markup language. Documatt is the tool for creating beautiful docs, manuals, or books for tech and novel writers.

## Inline elements

Paragraphs may contain *emphasized*, **strongly emphasized** words. Links to external webs like <https://documatt.com/blog/> are auto-recognized. Sometimes you need `monospaced text`. Useful are also {sup}`superscript` or {sub}`subscript`.

## Lists

Unordered lists usually use `*` as bullet symbol:

- A bullet list item
- Second item
- A sub item

Ordered (enumerated) lists that are auto-numbered start with `#.`:

1. one
2. two
3. three

## Showing code examples

It's easy to show code parts with `inline literal` or literal block:

```
some literal text
```

Or, literal block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {   // shows 0, then 1, then 2
    alert(i);
}
```
